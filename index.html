							Growing up, I played a lot of games mostly on PC. My favorite genre of games are massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) 
							and Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games. Some games I play includes Maplestory, League Of Legends, Overwatch, Genshin Impact, Pokemon
							and Valorant. One game that I started to get into is called Eternal Return: Black Survival. It is a game that is still in its early stages,
							but I was able to play the early access on Steam.

							Another hobby of mine is drawing and painting. I draw and panit digitally and traditional. There is a art portfolio in the list at the top
							of the page. I started drawing since I was young though out highschool and during my free time now. 
							In highschool, I was in an art pathway and so I took a lot of art classes. 
							I would say my drawing style is a mix between anime style and realistic style.
